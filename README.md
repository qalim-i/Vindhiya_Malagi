This site showcases her professional journey, academic contributions, research publications, and leadership in innovation.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **[React](https://react.dev/)**: Frontend library for building the user interface.

- **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)**: Beautiful & consistent icon toolkit.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is structured to separate data from the UI components:

- **`src/sections/`**: Contains the main sections of the landing page (Hero, About, Experience, Projects, Contact).
- **`profile.json`**: Acts as the central data source for the website. You can update personal details, experience, publications, and projects here without touching the React code.
- **`src/components/`**: Reusable UI components.
- **`src/`**: Main application entry points (`App.jsx`, `main.jsx`).

## 📝 Customization

To update the content of the portfolio:

1. Open `profile.json` in the root directory.
2. Modify the JSON fields such as `personal_information`, `professional_summary`, `publications`, etc.
3. The changes will automatically reflect on the website.
